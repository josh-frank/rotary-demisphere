# rotary-demisphere

A **rotary demisphere** is a spiral-shaped Moir√© pattern formed entirely by concentric circles. The concept is named after [a 1925 kinetic sculpture](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/81432) by [Marcel Duchamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Duchamp). These patterns are frequently found in nature: wave interference in physics, weather patterns, biology, and more.

No spiral is ever drawn onscreen in this app.

The **pure SVG version** of this app preserves its functionality without the need for a server, deployment, build, etc. This version uses URL parameters instead of a UI to input demispheres.
