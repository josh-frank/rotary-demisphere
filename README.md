# rotary-demisphere

A **rotary demisphere** is a spiral-shaped Moir√© pattern formed entirely by concentric circles. The concept is named after [a 1925 kinetic sculpture](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/81432) by [Marcel Duchamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Duchamp). These patterns looks very similar to wave interference patterns found in nature all the time.

No spiral is ever drawn onscreen in this app.
